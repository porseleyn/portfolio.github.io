									<h3>Digital Drumset</h3>
									<p>For the course Creative Programming we learned to program in Processing (Java) and PlugData (PureData). 
										At the end of the course we had to create a cool program in both Processing and PlugData. 
										In Processing I made an interactive drumset and in PlugData I made a presentation trainer for shy people 
										that tells you to either speak up or tone it down based on a set volume.

									<h3>PianoSheetAI</h3>
									<p>The course Human Computer Interaction and Information Visualisation taught us to 
										develop an interactive platform on our own and user test it. 
										We went through the whole cycle of developing personas, user analyses, sketches, prototypes, 
										scenarios, task analyses and usability specifications. 
										Eventually we came up with PianoSheetAI: a pianosheet generator for musicians with a 
										creative block.
										We presented it in a very theatrical way and that landed us a prize for best presentation!

									<img src="images/pianosheetAI.jpg" alt="PianoSheetAI" style="width:55%; height:auto;">

									<p>A year later we further developed the web app for the course Computational Creativity, 
										but this time with a focus on the co-creative aspect of gaining inspiration.

									<h3>Future Toys</h3>
									<p>For the course Meta Media we had one fulltime week to come up with a project based on our

										makes the buyer think twice about the toys we give to children, how we unintendedly pass on 
										the ideals to our children. We just did it less sugarcoated.
									</p>

									<p>Therefore we present to you, Botox Barbie and the Lego Shisha Lounge!</p>

									<h3>The Night Forest</h3>
									<p>For the course Sound, Space and Interaction we were taught a lot about sound, acoustics and how 
										to work with PureData. Together with Dom we created an interactive large-scale auditory art installation 
										mimicking a walk in a forest at night. You had to hold a Vive tracker (programmed through Unity and SteamVR) to navigate 
										through three levels of exploration depending on the height of the position: a water, ground, and sky level. 
										You can discover the animals in the forest, but do not get too or the animals get scared and run away to another 
										hiding spot.

									<h3>Better Together</h3>
									<p>For the course Artificial Creatures we had to come up with our own artificial creature(s). 
										The one requirement was that it had one human quality: and we chose the need for togetherness. 
										The whole class exhibited their creatures and it was a nice premiere for our little robots!
										We also had to create our personal pages on a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/artificialcreatures2024/student-portfolios/emma-boom/superstition?authuser=0" class="event">shared website</a>, 
										if you are interested you can take a look at what me and my classmates did.

									<h3>Minecraft Platformer</h3>
									<p>I really wanted to do a course together with my friend, so it was a bonus when we decided 
										to do the same course Game AI Algorithms. For this course we did a Minecraft assignment where 
										we had to write an algorithm that would generate a village suited to any environment. We also 
										used Monte Carlo Tree Search in a Pacman algorithm that was supposed to be invincible. 
										Our best and last assignment was with a big group and we liked the Minecraft assignment 
										so much that we decided to build a platformer game in Minecraft, with specific levels and challenges. 
										See the video if you want to be impressed.

											<p>Frisbee people are just cool. I mean, just look at this screenshot 
												of the annotation program that I used: that is not a frisbee no, 
												that is a dog. Because during timeouts, dogs are better to zoom in 
												on than people.
											</p>

											<p> Fun fact: I had presented with the results of 12 annotated games, 
												but for the final thesis I had decided to annotate 4 more games. 
												This resulted in not 5 significant performance indicators, but 
												8 out of 11!! Whoop whoop!
